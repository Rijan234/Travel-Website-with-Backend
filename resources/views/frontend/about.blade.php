                Bhedetar is a developing tourist spot. It is a small hill station just 16 kilometers away from Dharan Sub-metropolis. It has unpredictable weather - one moment it hides itself in the blanket of thick fog and another moment it reveals itself as the crown of urban Dharan. it is also known as a transit point to the namaste jharna, which is a waterfall.
